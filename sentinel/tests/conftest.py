"""Test-suite isolation from the developer's local `.env`.

`sentinel.config.settings` calls `load_dotenv()` at import, so whatever sits in a
developer's `.env` leaks into every `get_settings()` call the suite makes. That
was harmless while nobody had a webhook secret configured — the M0 gate only
enforces signatures "when a secret is set", and no secret was ever set locally.

Preparing for production breaks that assumption: the moment `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
lands in `.env`, ~46 webhook tests start getting 401 instead of their expected
status, because they post unsigned bodies. CI never saw it (no `.env` in the
runner), so the suite passed there and failed on the machine that was closest to
shipping — the worst way round.

The fixture below pins the deployment-posture variables to a known-empty state for
every test. Tests that need one set it themselves with `monkeypatch.setenv`, which
still wins: this runs at setup, before the test body.
